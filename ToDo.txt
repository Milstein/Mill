1. Figure out basic structure of the program:

A good reference: http://www.smartlittlegames.com/ninemensmorris

	GUI
	Backend Game system

2. Details
	GUI: status panel (indicate the status of the game)
		gameboard panel (black and white 9 men piles, the gameboard)
		action panel ( New game, make a move, take back )
		
    Backend game system:
        The game board can be designed as a set of 24 points, each with a (x,y) cooridnate.
        Determine a legal move (place a men on the board in the free space// move a men to its adjacent point// move to any free space when "flying" condition is met.) 
		check the status of the game at each move (whether it is white/black's turn, or if white/black wins).
		 
3. Draw the game board first.
